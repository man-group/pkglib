PkgLib: Company-centric Python packaging and testing library
============================================================

Kindly open-sourced by AHL, this library has the goal of providing a 
one-stop-shop for Python development houses to get up and running using Python 
with the minimum of fuss in a Linux development environment.

*IMPORTANT*: this library has a bit of cleanup work to be done before it is 
releasable on pypi.python.org (like getting all the tests passing again), 
this will be completed over the next couple of months.

This library has three main components: 

- ``pkglib``: a set of packaging tools which extend on a number of the major 
  packaging toolsets in Python - distribute, pip and zc.buildout.
              
- ``pkglib.testing``: a suite of testing utilities to assist with handling 
  services, databases, web drivers and coverage amongst other things, as well 
  as a number of useful ``py.test`` plugins.
                      
- ``pkglib.project_template``: a PasteScript template for generating packages 
  that integrate with ``pkglib``
                          
Headline Features
=================

PkgLib
------

- Package metadata all sourced from text-file ``setup.cfg``, making it easier 
  to parse package configuration by other releated tools.
  
- Advanced dependency management:

  + Allows configuration of in-house company packages that are treated 
    differently than third-party libraries.
  + Backtracking dependency resolver to solve the difficult 'diamond problem' 
    of version resolution in complex dependency graphs.
  + Understands 'dev' and 'release' version streams, allowing the user to 
    operate in either mode. 
  + Tools to visualise dependency graphs from your current virtualenv.

- Improved PyPI interaction, prompts for user credentials and raises correct 
  Unix return codes on error.
  
- Installer search path support to allow eggs to be linked into virtualenvs 
  from shared disk, an important feature when working on shared filesystems in 
  large teams.  
  
- Keeps things neat and tidy - cleans out unused packages from your virtualenv's 
  site-packages directory. 
  
- Py.Test integration with ``python setup.py test``:

  + Configured for sensible defaults for code coverage and quality analysis
  + Detects when running under Jenkins and Hudson, swapping to file-based 
    reporting and altering tempfile creation.
    
- Command-line tool for managing software 'platforms', an abstraction upon 
  single packages when large numbers of interdependant packages are released 
  together.

- Checkout and setup packages from in-house repositories by name rather than 
  url.
   
- Numerous powerful ``setup.py`` targets:

  + Combine standalone package docs with automatic API documentation using 
    Sphinx.
  + Run tests using gcov to allow gathering code coverage of C/C++ extensions.
  + Synchronise checkouts and libraries with VCS and PyPI
  + Create Jenkins/Hudson builds.
  + Generate revision-linked development eggs for build systems.
  + Generate test-only eggs to capture test code and runtime options.
  + Deploy package to versioned virtualenvs.

- 'Batteries Included' project template


PkgLib.Testing
--------------

- Utilities with associated Py.Test fixture plugins for:

  + Profiling code execution, including C/C++ extensions
  + Managing temp dirs
  + Creating virutalenvs
  + Creating ``pkglib`` enabled packages
  + Running up servers instances in a port-safe manner, with save, restore and 
    teardown.
  + Supported servers include jenkins, redis, mongodb, Pyramid and (TODO) a 
    minimal PyPI implementation.
  + Selenium Webdriver, integrated with the Pyramid server runner plugin.
- Page Objects pattern implementation for better structured Selenium tests.
- Mocking implementations for databases and other common types.


Roadmap
=======

* Full support for git and mercurial.
* OSX support
* Python 2.4 -> 3.x support for core distlib functionality.
* Upgrade to latest versions of distribute, and bring the project in-line with 
  recent developements in the Python packaging space like ``distlib``.
* Add support for wheel binary distribution format.
